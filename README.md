# US_gasoline_demand_function
This project aims to create an econometric model to estimate the gasoline demand function in US and its elasticity, given a set of data. It contains:
- time series data about US gasoline price and consumption, real US GDP from 1991 (2Q) to 2022 (1Q);  
- a gretl script to estimate the gasoline demand function in US, its income and price elasticity in the short and in the long term;
- a short report to explain the reasoning behind the script.
